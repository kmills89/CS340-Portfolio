# 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  When creating programs that are maintainable, I make sure the functionality created within that code is kept current and continuously debugged. This allows my code to be modular and reusable for future projects. Readability is one of the most important considerations when developing my programs. Having my code properly structured and having detailed comments within the code gives other developers a better understanding of what my code is doing. Adaptability and maintaining code go hand and hand. In Project One, I created CRUD functionality that was then adapted and used for my Project Two dashboard. The advantages of these concepts are to create a modular workflow, which will increase the production of programs and create applications that can be debugged and fixed more easily.
